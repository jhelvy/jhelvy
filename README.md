### Hello! üëã

My name is **John Paul Helveston** and I am an Assistant Professor in [EMSE](https://www.emse.seas.gwu.edu/) @ [GWU](https://www.gwu.edu/). On GitHub you'll usually see me contributing to research projects, R packages, courses I develop / teach, or other fun side projects. I can speak English, Chinese, R (base + tidyverse) fluently as well as some moderate Python, CSS, and HTML. Find out more at my website: [jhelvy.com](https://jhelvy.com/) üòÑ
